This is a library to perform arithmetic in two fixed-point data formats.  The
short format is a WORD, the long format a DWORD.  Each format places the point
right in the middle of the bit range. This gives the short format a precision
of ~0.0039 and a range of +127.996 to -128. The long format has precision
~0.000015 and range +32767.999985 to -32768. Additionally, the long format has
the benefit of the high-order word representing the integer part of the number.
